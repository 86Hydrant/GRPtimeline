{
"timelineData" : [
{
"year" : "",
"category" : "",
"info" : "",
"link" : ""
}
}
]
}

to make the switch on excel we write the following line of code
keep in mind that excel uses '' instead of JSON's ""
="{'year':'"&A2&"','category':'"&B2&"','info':'"&C2&"','link':'"&D2&"'},"

to make the excel sheet make the perfect convention substitude() to switch
'' to JSON's ""

\" to write in JSON
